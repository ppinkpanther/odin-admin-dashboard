# odin-admin-dashboard
A simple frontend build of a dashboard built to practice grid layouts. 


TO-DO: 

Re-do the layout for .main-content. Instead of dividing this into multiple grids, might be easier to just make it one big grid and make the extra-content section just span multiple grid lines. Have to think about this later.
